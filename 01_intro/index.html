<h3>Week 1: Final Project Proposal</h3>

<p class = "margin"></p>
Here are 2 ideas for my final project
<p class = "margin"></p>

<h4>Idea 1 : Remote Arm</h4>
<p class = "margin"></p>

I have always been fascinated with the concept of live mimicry/communication between
two objects.  This first idea here stems from Doctor Octavius' arm.  The goal is you can create a robotic arm and control its movement 
through motors based on a remote control
unit (for example, a joystick) over radio communication.  Another extension to
this may be instead to control the movement based on strappable sensors to
one's hand: moving the thumb, for example, can signal the robot to rotate
its base motor in a certain direction.  This arm design shown below is very similar to
what I had in mind.  Some possible components I may use include radio communication, a microcontroller,
a servo for rotation, and an accelerometer for movement-detection.

<h4>Idea 2: Magical Wand </h4>
<p class = "margin"></p>

This second idea also stems from the ability to control one object with another
(in other words, let it respond through mimicry or a pre-defined response).
Here, the goal would be to create a wand that can cause another unit (such as a light) 
to respond based on the movement-pattern of the wand.  For example, a sharp flick
would light up the light with a bright-safe flash.  If this can somehow be combined
with the first idea, I could potentially pursue that avenue as well.
Some possible components I may use include radio communication, a microcontroller,
and an accelerometer for movement-detection.
